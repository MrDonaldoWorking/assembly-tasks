The light novel is the source for this, season 3 covered up to the start of volume 10, 13 is the most recent release. The accursed YenPress put an end to the high quality light novel fan translations by Skythewood at the end of volume 9, Overlord Translations was formed to fight back and is actually caught up. Meanwhile, the low quality/not free Yenpress' volume 9 comes out on January 22, 2019.

As for the next anime season, it is unfortunate but as it stands there is not enough Light Novel material for a 4th season. The earliest we could see a 4th season albeit with filler would be mid-late 2019. That however is extremely unlikely for this type of anime, there will not realistically be enough source material until 2021.

Putting aside source material, Madhouse is the company who produced this anime. They are unfortunately not known for making sequels, even this getting 3 entire seasons from them could be said to be extremely unusual... So while it is unfortunate there is a chance that we may never get another season of Overlord.

However on the bright side, someone else might pick up Overlord eventually due to its immense popularity... For example, One Punch Man season 1 was also made by Madhouse, while its second season is not being produced by them. At the least we cannot expect season 4 anytime soon or if it is soon, at the same quality we have seen so far due to a lack of material.

You can also read the original source, that being the web novel which is still in translation by Frostfire. However it is worth noting that the web novel and light novel supposedly diverge heavily at volume 10. This could be seen as a positive or negative, you will not spoil the future anime for yourself (if it ever happens) if you read the web novel.
